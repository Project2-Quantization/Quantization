Quantization

In this group project, a system is opened  autonomous to detect defective production series of silicon wafers.
The innovative system will be based on a data base, the information is centered on all known defects in the production line.

working stages:
1. download and install program
2. open file of input to read.
3. validate input.
4. Create a dinamic variable (String) that will hold the information we read from input file.
5. read file to EOF.
6. Open the output file where we will put the alphabetic list.
7. Make a linked list that has a substring with matching alphabet.
8. Devide the coded String to substring which are called paragraphs, every paragraph is matching to the final alphabet.
9. Every time that we devide the string we go over the linked list, if there was already such a substring go over a bigger substring.
10. There has to be held an ascii counter to hold the next free value.
11. Connect the nodes from list to a string
12. write the string to the output file

extern cases were also supported.
